    <h1>About RecipeCraft</h1>
    <p>
      RecipeCraft is a basic clean and lean place to save and manage your favorite recipes.
      You may be a student with a limited budget, you are a busy professional and you are simply someone who
      prefers trying something new, RecipeCraft stores all your recipes in a single location making them
      accessible, easy to update and reuse.
    </p>

    <h2>What RecipeCraft Is Used For</h2>
    <p>
      The site will serve as your personal recipe book. You do not need to go through
      screenshots, notes, and older messages to find information about every meal; instead,
      it is possible to store all the meals in a clean format with the most important
      information you need when cooking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recipes may have the name, ingredients, detailed steps, preparation time, cooking time,
      equipment needed, comments, and optional images. This allows anyone to repeat a meal
      exactly—or improve it over time.
